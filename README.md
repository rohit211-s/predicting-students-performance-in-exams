The ultimate goal of any educational institution is offering the best educational experience and
knowledge to the students. Identifying the students who need extra support and taking the
appropriate actions to enhance their
performance plays an important role in achieving that goal. In this research, four machine learning
techniques have been used to build a classifier that can predict the performance of the students in a
computer science subject that is offered by Al-Muthanna University (MU), College Of Humanities. The
machine learning techniques include Artificial
Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression. This research pays extra attention
to the effect
of using the internet as a learning resource and the effect of the time spent by students on social
networks on the students’ performance. These effects introduced by using features that measure
whether the student uses the internet
for learning and the time spent on the social networks by the students. The models have been compared
using the ROC
index performance measure and the classification accuracy. In addition, different measures have been
computed such
as the classification error, precision, recall, and the F measure. The dataset used to build the models is
collected based
on a survey given to the students and the students’ grade book. The ANN (fully connected feed forward
multilayer ANN) model achieved the best performance that is equal to 0.807 and achieved the best
classification accuracy that is equal to 77.04%. In addition, the decision tree model identified five factors
as important factors which influence the
performance of the students.
